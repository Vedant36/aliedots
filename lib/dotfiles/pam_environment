# Environment variables set by PAM for a user session.
#
# This file is only read by pam_env(8) if it is loaded with user_readenv=1. We
# use it for a single purpose: to set XDG_CONFIG_HOME, so that
# systemd-environment-d-generator(8) loads the environment.d(5) files from the
# right place (this solves the chicken-or-egg problem for setting
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME).

# Ugly workaround for Debian (as they ship an ancient version of PAM):
HOME                  DEFAULT="/home/@{PAM_USER}" OVERRIDE="@{HOME}"

# Set XDG_CONFIG_HOME:
XDG_CONFIG_HOME       DEFAULT="${HOME}/.local/etc"

# Set ZDOTDIR:
ZDOTDIR               DEFAULT="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/zsh"

# Any further environment variables are set with environment.d.
